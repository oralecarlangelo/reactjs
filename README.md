# Functional Components
## Overview
Functional components are a fundamental concept in React.js that allow you to create reusable UI components using JavaScript functions. In this topic, we will explore how to create and use functional components in React.

## Creating Functional Components
Functional components are defined as JavaScript functions that return JSX. Here's an example of a basic functional component:


```javascript

import React from 'react';

function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello, Functional Component!</h1>;
}
```

In the above example, we have defined a functional component called Greeting that returns a JSX element representing a heading with the text "Hello, Functional Component!". Functional components are typically written as JavaScript functions and follow a naming convention where the function name starts with a capital letter.

## Using Functional Components
To use a functional component, you can simply include it as JSX within another component or the root of your application. Here's an example of using the `Greeting` component within another component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Greeting from './Greeting';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting />
    </div>
  );
}

```

In the above example, we import the `Greeting` component and include it within the JSX of the `App` component. This renders the `Greeting` component as part of the App component's content.

Functional components can also accept props as input to customize their behavior or content. You can pass props to a functional component just like any other JSX attribute.

## Benefits of Functional Components
Functional components offer several benefits in React development:

**Simplicity**: Functional components are simpler and easier to read and understand compared to class components.
**Reusability**: Functional components are highly reusable, allowing you to create modular and maintainable code.
**Performance**: Functional components are lightweight and have a lower memory footprint, resulting in better performance.
